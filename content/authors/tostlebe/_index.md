Dr. Tostlebe’s research focuses on incarceration and reentry; misconduct and recidivism; gangs in institutions and communities; empirical tests of criminological theory; and correctional evaluations. She served as the project manager for a statewide study investigating the impact of solitary confinement—and a step-down program—on incarcerated individuals and prisons in Oregon. 

Dr. Tostlebe’s current projects focus on reentry initiatives in Omaha evaluating the Never Give Up (NGU) Transitional Living program; Nebraska’s legislatively mandated evaluation of structured programming within the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services; and a five-year Arnold Ventures–funded collaboration with the Iowa Board of Parole and Iowa Department of Corrections to develop and evaluate a decision-support tool designed to reduce overcrowding and support evidence-based parole decisions.

She serves on the editorial boards of [*Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency*](https://journals.sagepub.com/editorial-board/JRC) and [*Corrections*](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ucor20/about-this-journal#editorial-board). Her research has appeared in outlets such as *Criminology*, *Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency*, *Health & Justice*, *Homicide Studies*, and *Preventive Medicine*. She co-hosts [The Criminology Academy Podcast](https://www.thecriminologyacademy.com), which is supported by the ARC Lab.
