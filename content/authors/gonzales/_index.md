Taylor Gonzales is a Doctoral student in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha. My research interests center around corrections, recidivism, and program evaluations. I am currently working on a few different projects related to the realm of corrections. First, I am working with Dr. Jennifer Tostlebe on a grant-funded project examining a local reentry program. Our project goal is to establish the process and procedures for the reentry program while also tracking prior participants of the program to gauge their success post-program. Additionally, I am working with Dr. Zachary Hamilton on a manuscript that seeks to compare risk and need scores at four different time points, ranging from 6 months prior to release to 18 months post-release. Our goal is to determine if and how needs shift over time and to assess the impact of these changes on recidivism risk. Lastly, I am working with a former advisor, Dr. Ahram Cho from New Mexico State University and Dr. Alexander Updegrove from University of North Texas on a drug court related manuscript. We are utilizing group-based trajectory modeling to identify patterns of early in-program substance use and assess their effect on overall program completion.
