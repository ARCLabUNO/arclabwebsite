In 2017 the Washington State Department of Corrections (WADOC) implemented their Offender Needs Evaluation (ONE), which is used to assess the recidivism risk and programming needs of all individuals supervised in prison facilities and the community. As part of a validation and redesign of the tool, the WADOC has contracted with ARC Lab to improve item content, prediction, and equity of the toolâ€™s prediction. This two-year project will develop dynamic criminal history measures, create psychometrically valid needs domains, and set classification level used to guide supervision contacts in the community.
