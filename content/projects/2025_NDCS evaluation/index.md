In 2022, Nebraska’s State Legislature modified the previously enacted LB 896 to provide evaluation resources for NDCS programs to ensure the effectiveness of institutional programs serving Nebraska’s incarcerated population. LB 896 defines structured programming as clinical treatment programs, non-clinical programs, and other nonrecreational interventions administered within NDCS’s secure facilities. The statute requires structured programming to be evaluated for quality, including whether program participation reduces recidivism. In late 2022, NDCS contracted with the University of Nebraska Omaha to evaluate these programs. The primary goal of the evaluation was to determine if programs were being delivered with fidelity and achieving intended outcomes. LB 896 also required that the evaluation provide “a rating on the effectiveness of the program."

This is a four-year project funded by the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services.
