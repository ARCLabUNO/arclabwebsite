publication: "Best Practices in Sexual Offender Assessment and Management"
publication_short: ""

abstract: Juvenile Sex Offenders (JSOs) are often the subject of public scrutiny and fear. In turn, these juveniles have been exposed to adult policies such as sex offender registries despite significant evidence that they differ from their adult counterparts (Chaffin, 2008, Child Maltreatment, 13, 110â€“121). Given this complex history, the following chapter describes the current state of the literature around assessing and treating JSOs. Specifically, special considerations that should be made for JSOs, are highlighted such as the differences between problematic sexual behavior and sexual offending and the impact of labeling on this population. The chapter further provides an overview of the current literature surrounding methodological considerations when creating and using assessments. Further, an overview of current treatments for JSOs and what considerations should be made when picking a treatment plan is provided. Finally, this chapter suggests directions for future research.
