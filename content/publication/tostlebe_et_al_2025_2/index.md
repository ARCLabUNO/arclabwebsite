abstract: This study examines how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped the daily work of frontline community corrections staff from pretrial, probation, parole board, and parole agencies. In collaboration with the National Institute of Corrections (NIC), we conducted six focus groups with a broad range of community corrections staff (N=47). Three major themes emerged following analysis of the focus group data, including (1) strains in staffing capacity; (2) challenges of working from home; and (3) barriers to client management. After identifying these themes, bounded rationality became a meaningful lens through which to understand the data. Results underscore a need to further reductions in the community corrections population, expansions in staff recruitment and retention efforts, and emergency response planning. This is particularly true as we look toward the future of the U.S. correctional system and strategies being developed and implemented to reduce institutional populations.
