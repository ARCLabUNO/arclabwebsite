abstract: In this chapter, we document the landscape of healthcare in corrections. We begin by describing what is known about healthcare and death in U.S. prisons. Second, using publicly available data on state Department of Corrections (DOC) websites, we document and describe healthcare policies (e.g., delivery of physical, dental, and mental healthcare) and administrative and procedural stated practices (e.g., intake assessment timeframe, copays, healthcare provider). Deaths in custody are also summarized, including policy, numbers of death, and if causes of death are accessible. We conclude by discussing research and policy implications that would result in positive benefits for incarcerated individuals, DOC facilities, friends and family of incarcerated individuals, and the safety of the general public.
