abstract: Despite evidence that associations between autonomic nervous system (ANS) responsivity and psychopathic traits vary across stress task only a single study has systematically assessed cross-task differences in associations. To advance this limited literature the current study randomized subjects into either a noise blast (countdown) task or a social stressor speech task (SSST). Analyses tested associations between ANS (heart rate, skin conductance) and measures of psychopathic traits (Self-Report Psychopathy Scale-III (SRP-III), Inventory of Callous-Unemotional (ICU) traits, Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP), Sensation Seeking Scaleâ€“ Form V (SSS-V)). Baseline skin conductance was negatively associated with Erratic Lifestyle (SRP-III) and SSS-V total scores. Heart rate during the SSST had a negative association with Callous Affect (SRP). During the countdown task there was a negative association between skin conductance in anticipation of signaled noise blasts and Interpersonal Manipulation (SRP), and a negative association between change in heart rate after noise blasts in unsignaled trials and Erratic Lifestyle (SRP) and Factor 2 Psychopathy (LSRP).
