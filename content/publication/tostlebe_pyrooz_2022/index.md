abstract: >
  A top priority of prison authorities is maintaining a safe and orderly institutional environment.
  Gangs are believed to impede this objective, warranting bespoke policies and practices. Drawing 
  on the process-based model of regulation, we depart from orthodox explanations for the 
  gangâ€“misconduct link and argue that gang affiliates are treated less fairly than nongang affiliates 
  owing to suppression-oriented administrative policies and harsher day-to-day interactions with officers, 
  which, in turn, impact compliance.
