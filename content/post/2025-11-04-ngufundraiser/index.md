During the Never Give Up (NGU) Transitional Living Program Fundraiser on November 4th, Dr. [Jenn Tostlebe](https://arcorrectionslab.org/author/jennifer-tostlebe/) and doctoral student [Taylor Gonzales](https://arcorrectionslab.org/author/taylor-gonzales/) presented on their collaborative partnership with NGU Program Director Shane Reilly. Together, they have developed an evaluation framework for the program — an important first step toward a comprehensive process and outcome evaluation. Supported by the Sherwood Foundation, this effort reflects a shared commitment to evidence-based practice, community engagement, and lasting reentry success. Taylor was also awarded GRACA funding to advance the process evaluation, which will form the foundation of her dissertation.
